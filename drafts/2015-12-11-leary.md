Timothy Francis Leary - September 1950

### Overview

This archive contains full high resolution scans of Timothy Leary's PhD dissertation *"The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure"* from when he was a student at UC Berkeley. The only remaining publicly available copy is held by the University library and is "restricted use" due to the high number of thefts [2]. As far as I know, this is the first copy available on the internet.

Enjoy!

### Scan

These images were scanned at the [UC Berkeley Doe Public Library](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/libraries/doe-library) using their free book scanner between November 20, 2015 and December
 10, 2015. The highest scan quality possible was selected. Initial attempts at lossless `.tiff` output were unsuccessful so maximum-quality `.jpg` was chosen instead.
