![iBurn on iPad](http://www.iburnapp.com/img/ipad.png)

iBurn is an offline map and guide for the [Burning Man](http://www.burningman.com) art festival. For the 2014 release we [rewrote it from scratch](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-iOS) for iOS 7 on top of some really awesome open source software. We decided to use [YapDatabase](https://github.com/yaptv/YapDatabase)+[Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) instead of Core Data, and [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk) instead of MapKit for our [offline map tiles](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Maps). For users of Android devices, [David Brodsky](https://github.com/onlyinamerica) developed a version of [iBurn for Android](https://github.com/Burning-Man-Earth/iBurn-Android).
