I just finished redesigning [chatsecure.org](https://chatsecure.org) ([source code](https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure.github.io)) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the beautiful [Incorporated](http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com) theme. Here's a link to the [old version](https://web.archive.org/web/20131017232603/https://chatsecure.org/) of the website for reference.

One of the main motivations for the redesign was to include information about the recently re-branded Android version of ChatSecure (previously it was called Gibberbot). A large number of support requests for Android started showing up in the iOS GitHub Issues and UserVoice pages, so hopefully this new design should help guide people in the right direction.

Overall I have been very pleased with the zen of writing blog posts and other content in Markdown, and keeping it version controlled with git. Storing text in a database (especially without version control) just seems so broken now.
