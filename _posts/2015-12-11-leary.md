Timothy Francis Leary - September 1950

### Overview

This archive contains full high resolution scans of Timothy Leary's PhD dissertation *"The Social Dimensions of Personality: Group Process and Structure"* from when he was a student at UC Berkeley. The only remaining publicly available copy is held by the University library and is "restricted use" due to the high number of thefts [2]. As far as I know, this is the first copy available on the internet.

Enjoy!
