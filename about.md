Feel free to reach out if you're interested in open source software, cryptography / secure communications, video encoding, or iOS development. I love building open source technology to protect our privacy and civil liberties.

## Recent Work

### ChatSecure

[ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org) is a free and open source encrypted chat client for iPhone and Android that supports OTR encryption over XMPP. I founded this project back in 2011 and since then it has grown to see worldwide adoption and is currently available in over 20 languages.

### Kickflip

[Kickflip](https://kickflip.io) is an open-source live broadcasting SDK for iOS and Android devices that enables developers to easily create live video products. I co-founded this project alongside David Brodsky and Rich Jones, inspired by the problems we faced when developing OpenWatch.

### OpenWatch

[OpenWatch](https://openwatch.net) is a global citizen news network combined with a suite of mobile applications for covering events on the ground. It was born out of an open source project of the same name to monitor abuses of power via mobile video.
